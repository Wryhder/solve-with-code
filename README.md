My solutions to coding challenges

This is a way to have all my solutions to coding challenges in one place, and see how much improvement I've made over time.
I add a solution to a problem here and refactor when I learn better ways to tackle it. 
Simply check older versions of any file to see how the code has changed. Each file has the problem statement at/near the beginning.
